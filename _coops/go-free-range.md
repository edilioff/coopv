We are a co-operative with some of the most experienced software developers in the UK.

Wholly owned and run by the hands that build your software. We are self-organising: we donâ€™t have account managers; we want you to work with the doers instead of sayers.

Please approach us with projects that are _inspiring_; we absolutely _require a challenge_.

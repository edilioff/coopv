DCDC is a cooperative body built with technology at its heart (a platform coop). We dare to dream of a future where software is created collaboratively and distributed frictionlessly, a future where tech companies operate fairly and transparently, and a future where technology empowers individuals, by protecting the privacy and self-sovereignity of their data.

Animorph addresses unmet social and medical needs using augmented and virtual reality.

We provide a full range of services and products geared towards bespoke immersive app development, including research, design workshops, programming, consultation, video production, and sound design.

Since early 2016, we have been collaborating with social enterprises, medical researchers, and organisations including Southbank Centre, The Open University, and Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

We invite all stakeholders to participate in the development process. We excel at understanding the challenges expressed by our end-users; every story takes us on a unique journey.

Animorph Co-operative is democratically owned and run, with great care for the well-being of our workers, supporting professional as well as personal development.

Letâ€™s forge alliances for the future we want to live in.
